You know that thing where you want to **change the world** for the better but you’re not sure quite how then you come up with **the simplest of ideas** and then, for the first time, you actually **follow through** on the idea and get a ball rolling and before you know it **you’ve started something** that people are attracted to because it’s **making a difference** in a little corner of this mess we call humanity and you wake up each morning just incredibly **hyped to put in the work** to keep it growing because **it fills your heart and helps people?**

That thing, for me, is [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes).
